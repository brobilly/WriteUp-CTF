# Secret Of The Polyglot

Download the provided file and apparently its a .pdf and inside you'll find a part of the flag

```
1n_pn9_&_pdf_7f9bccd1}
```

I checked the file type and turns out its not a .pdf but a .png

```
#file flag2of2-final.pdf

flag2of2-final.pdf: PNG image data, 50 x 50, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

I renamed the extension to .png and opened it, and there i found the first part of the flag

**FLAG: picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_7f9bccd1}**
